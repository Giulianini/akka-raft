\section{Implementation Details}

Just report interesting / non-trivial / non-obvious implementation details.

This section is expected to be short in case some documentation (e.g. Java-doc or Swagger Spec) has been produced for the software artefacts.
%
This this case, the produced documentation should be referenced here.
